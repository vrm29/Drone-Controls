# Set to zero to return at the current altitude.

# The return altitude can be set from 1 to 8000 centimeters.

# The default return altitude Default is 15 meters (1500)

vehicle.RTL_ALT_FINAL=0
# : The altitude the copter will move to at the final stage of “Returning to Launch” or after completing a Mission.

# Set to zero to automatically land the copter.

# The final return altitude may be adjusted from 0 to 1000 centimeters.

vehicle.RTL_LOIT_TIME=5000
# : Time in milliseconds to hover/pause above the “Home” position before beginning final descent.

# The “Loiter” time may be adjusted from 0 to 60,000 milliseconds.

WP_YAW_BEHAVIOR=0
# : Sets how the autopilot controls the “Yaw” during Missions and RTL.

# 0 = Never change Yaw.

# 1 = Face Next Waypoint including facing home during RTL.

# 2 = Face Next Waypoint except for RTL (i.e. during RTL vehicle will remain pointed at its last heading)

LAND_SPEED=25
# : The descent speed for the final stage of landing in centimeters per second.

# The landing speed is adjustable from 20 to 200 centimeters per second.

# RTL_CLIMB_MIN: The vehicle will climb at least this many meters at the first stage of the RTL. By default this value is zero. (only Copter-3.3 and above)

# RTL_SPEED: The horizontal speed (in cm/s) at which the vehicle will return to home. By default this value is zero meaning it will use WPNAV_SPEED. (only Copter-3.4 and higher)

# RTL_CONE_SLOPE: Defines the slope of an inverted cone above home which is used to limit the amount the vehicle climbs when RTL-ing from close to home. Low values lead to a wide cone meaning the vehicle will climb less, High values will lead to the vehicle climbing more. (supported in Copter-3.4 and higher)
